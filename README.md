# L²M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling

Official code repository for the paper "[L²M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04725)".

## Overview

This repository contains code for reproducing the experiments and results from our paper, which establishes a bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. We formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L²M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `measure_mutual_info/`: Code for estimating bipartite mutual information using LLMs as well as the two-point mutual information
- `train_on_pg19/`: Code for experiments on the PG19 dataset
